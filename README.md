# Machine Learning Interactomic Potential Transition State Analysis
This is a repo for carrying out transition state benchmarking for machine learning interactomic potentials. This is a work in progress. \n
This work has been presented as a poster at MRS 2025 Spring Meeting & Exhibit titled "Curating Benchmarking Data Sets for Universal Machine Learning Interactomic Potentials Beyond Equilirbium" by Haoming Howard Li, Aaron D. Kaplan, Roberta Pascazio and Kristin A. Persson (University of California, Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory).
