# Machine Learning Interactomic Potential Transition State Analysis
This is a repo for carrying out transition state benchmarking for universal machine learning interactomic potentials (uMLIPs). This is a work in progress. \
This work has been presented as a poster at MRS 2025 Spring Meeting & Exhibit titled "Curating Benchmarking Data Sets for Universal Machine Learning Interactomic Potentials Beyond Equilirbium" by Haoming Howard Li, Aaron D. Kaplan, Roberta Pascazio and Kristin A. Persson (University of California, Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory).

For example usage, please refer to the tutorial jupyter notebook. This module's main purpose is to carry out benchmarking, but some helper scripts are provided to perform uMLIP calculations to be used in benchmarking as well.
